## Summary

### Project description

> The Architecture Training Path provides you with the theory behind the technology. Here we are teaching you about the concepts and ideas that shape the tools that Lightbend provides. These courses create a foundation for you to understand "why" Reactive Systems are built a certain way, not just "how" to build them. Once these foundations are in place, the concepts that are demonstrated in our other courses should be more clear, and easier to implement properly.
>
> These courses are presented without any code. This makes them an excellent place to learn about Reactive Systems whether you are a developer, an architect, a manager, or filling another role within your organization.
