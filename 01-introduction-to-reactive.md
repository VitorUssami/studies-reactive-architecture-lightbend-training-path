# Reactive Architecture: Introduction to Reactive Systems

> This course teaches the core principles behind Reactive Architecture. It introduces learners to why we need Reactive Systems, and what problems they are trying to solve. It also contrasts Reactive Architectures with Reactive Programming, showing how they relate, and how they are different.

### The Reactive Manifesto

[The Reactive Manifesto](Thttps://reactivemanifesto.org/) was Jonas Bon√©r, Dave Farley, Roland Kuhn, and Martin Thompson.

- Created in response to companies trying to cope with changes in software landscape
- Similar patterns for solving similar problems.
- <u>The reactive manifesto tries to put these common ideias into a single set of principles</u>


### The reactive principles [üîó](https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/)

#### Responsive

> A reactive system consistently responds in a timely fashion.

- Responsiveness is the cornerstone of usability
- Systems must respond in a fast and consistent fashion if at all possible
- Responsive systems build user confidence

#### Resilient

> A reactive system remains responsive, even when failures occur.

- Resilience provides responsiveness, despite failures
- Achieved thought replication, isolation, containment, delegation
    - Replication: means multiple copies
    - Isolation: means services can function on their own. They don't have external dependencies
    - Containment: If a failure occurs it's not propagated to because it is isolated
    - Delegation: recovery is managed by an external component
- Failures are isolated to a single component
- Recovery is delegated to an external component 

#### Elastic

> A reactive system remains responsive, despite changes to system load.

- Elasticity provides responsiveness, despite increases (or decreases) in load
- Implies zero contention and no central bottlenecks
- Predictive auto scaling techniques can be used to support elasticity
- Scaling up provides responsiveness during peak, while scaling down improves cost effectiveness


#### Message Driven

> A reactive system is built on a foundation of async, non-blocking messages.

- Responsiveness, Resilience, Elasticity are supported by a Message Driven Architecture
- Message are asynchronous and non-blocking
- Provides Loose coupling, isolation, location transparency
- Resources are consumed only while active



### The Actor Model

- The actor model is a programming paradigm that supports construction of Reactive Systems
- It's Message Driven
    - all communications between actors is done by non blocking messages
- Abstractions provide Elasticity and Resilience
    - location transparency
- It can be used to build Responsive software
- On the JVM:
    - Akka implements actions model


#### Fundamental concepts of the Actor Model

- All computation occurs inside of Actors
- Each actor has an address
- Actors communicate only through asynchronous messages


#### Location Transparency

- The Message driven nature of Actors supports location transparency
- Actors communicate using the same technique, regardless of location
- Local vs Remote is mostly configuration
- Location transparency enables actors to be both Resilient and Elastic

#### Importance of the Actor Model

- There are many reactive programming tools
- You often have to combine different technologies to build a reactive system
- The actor model provides facilities to support all of the reactive principles
    - message driven by default
    - location transparency to support elasticity and resilience through distribution
    - elasticity and resilience provides Responsiveness

#### Reactive systems without actors

![](/images/01/rs-without-actors.png)

- It's possible to have reactive systems WITHOUT using actors
- Component are added on rather then being built in
- Requires additional infrastructure such as
    - service registry
    - load balancer
    - message bus
- Result will be a reactive at a large scale, not necessarily the small
